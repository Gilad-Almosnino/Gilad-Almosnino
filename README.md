👋 Hi, I’m @Gilad-Almosnino
👀 I’m interested in Localization and Internationalization, AI technology, and developing solutions that make AI more practical and locally relevant.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI techniques, GPT model development, and the latest trends in international market research.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI-powered Localization and Internationalization solutions, GPT-powered applications, and industry standards for BIDI, UI mirroring and inclusive gender-related Localization.
